											<h2>About Us</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Project Confidence is a research effort to apply machine learning to mouse movements in order to measure a user's confidence.
											We are part of Professor Ray Simar's <a href="http://simar.rice.edu/dissect/">Team DISSECT</a>, a branch of the
											<a href="http://vip.rice.edu/">Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP)</a> at Rice University. Project Confidence has
											developed several applications such as MousePass and VeriVote (learn more about them below) and is currently researching other relevant sectors.</p>

										<h2>Our Story</h2>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/tamuhack.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</header>
									<p class="content">Project Confidence began as a hackathon idea at TamuHack in January 2019. Over 24 hours, what began as a simple mouse tracker developed into a passwordless authentication solution to determine confidence level in a user accessing an account. Although our team of freshmen had little experience with coding and none with machine learning, we were able to develop an effective model that demonstrated the power of machine learning to determine confidence. The judges at TamuHack 2019 recognized our potential and named us winners of the Charles Schwab Passwordless Authentication Challenge. However, we decided that this journey couldn’t end there. Upon returning to Rice University, Professor Ray Simar of the Electrical Engineering department took us under his wing and gave us the opportunity and motivation to take our slightly janky solution and rewrite the implementation of the interface from a Java applet to a cohesive online application of passwordless authentication, along with a much more complete and accurate model of determining confidence, which considers each trial separately and draws from a much larger set of training data. However, we realized that passwordless authentication was in fact just an application of our true goal: determining confidence through biometrics. In the pursuit of further development, we began working on determining the confidence of students answering questions, keeping mouse tracking as our vehicle for doing so. This new product, tentatively named “Verication”, is currently in development. </p>
