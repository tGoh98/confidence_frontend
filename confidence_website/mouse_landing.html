								<h2>What is MousePass?</h2>
								<p>MousePass is a passwordless authentication service that takes advantage of the human ability to retain childhood events and memories to create a fun, easy, and secure way to log into any major retailer or banking service. This is a innovative leap in the cybersecurity industry that is seemingly simple yet thoroughly sophisticated. By simply answering a few personalized questions about your life, you forgo putting in a long, complicated, and easy to remember password and enjoy an efficient machine learning assisted experience in accessing your personal files.

Identity theft is a severe and growing problem for people who store their data online. According to the Pew Institute, about 49% of internet users write down their password on a piece of paper and 24% save them in a note on a computer or mobile device. These security methods are often adopted by those unwilling to join the 12% of the population who have adopted password managers.

 As a result, password authentication has become and increasingly important topic. As the focus of security has turned more towards biometrics, the need to account for users’ prior knowledge has become a significant hurdle due to the difficulty of accessing and storing this data securely. However, since the advent of machine learning, mouse movement pattern recognition has emerged as a novel potential solution to these problems. Research done by Morano, et. Al (2017) has shown that mouse movement can differ significantly for users who are answering questions truthfully compared to users who have merely memorized or have stolen someone else’s information (seen in Graph 1). This fact can be used to develop a one-size-fits all model for identity verification.

Even among those technologically adept, just 30% of "online adults worry about the overall security of their online passwords" and just 14% use complex passwords rather than simple ones. MousePass solves this by removing the need for passwords at all, instead relying on the human nature to remember intimate and special momories. Logging into your account with MousePass is simple and effective, yet fun and exciting.

								<h2>How Does MousePass Work?</h2>
								<p>MousePass asks a series of questions that corresponds to a user’s personal information with mouse tracking that returns a confidence interval. If a user fails to answer within a certain confidence, then their answers will be considered wrong even if they have entered the correct answer. This adds a layer of security that protects against identity fraud. </p>
